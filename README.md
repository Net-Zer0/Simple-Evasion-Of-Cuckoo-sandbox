# Sandbox Evasion Detection Script

## Overview
This PowerShell script is part of a cybersecurity research project exploring **sandbox evasion techniques through environmental fingerprinting**. The script detects sandbox indicators—such as specific DLL files, known directory structures, and file hashes—and terminates execution upon detection. This approach contributes to the study of anti-sandbox methodologies by analyzing how analysis environments can be identified and bypassed.

## Features
- **DLL Detection:** Searches for the presence of `cuckoomon.dll`, a common indicator of sandbox environments like Cuckoo Sandbox.
- **Hash Detection:** Compares file hashes against a predefined list associated with virtualized or analysis environments.
- **Directory Detection:** Identifies storage directories used in malware analysis sandboxes.
- **Exit Mechanism:** If any indicators are detected, the system shuts down to prevent further execution.

## Research Focus
- **Environmental Fingerprinting:** Detecting subtle artifacts left by sandbox environments that can indicate non-native execution.
- **Unconventional Detection Techniques:** Experimenting with novel methods, including leveraging system inconsistencies and behavioral triggers.
- **Practical Cybersecurity Applications:** Understanding how malware and security tools interact within controlled environments to strengthen detection capabilities.
